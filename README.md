The clock is ticking, the page is blank, and focus feels impossible — a struggle every student knows. That’s why we created StudiCircle, a gamified productivity platform designed to help students manage their time, tasks, and studying with less stress and more consistency. With 86% of high schoolers procrastinating, we knew change was needed.

StudiCircle brings together focus rooms, AI-powered task planning, Pomodoro timers, a supportive community, and customizable dashboards to make studying more engaging. Students can track daily stats, join or create focus rooms, make motivational posts, and use the AI study tool to plan assignments or get homework help. Tasks are organized by daily, upcoming, and completed, helping students stay accountable.

Gamification — including streaks, XP, levels, themes, and study pets — keeps students motivated, while community posts build encouragement and connection.
The unproductive days are over. 

StudiCircle is off to a great start — but we’re only getting started.

Our next major goal is to develop an AI-powered anti-bullying detector that keeps the community safe, positive, and free from harmful interactions. We want every student to feel supported and encouraged while using StudiCircle.

We also plan to build an AI focus detector that can recognize whether a student is actually working on the task they set. If they become idle or drift into unrelated activities, StudiCircle will gently notify them to help refocus and stay aligned with their goals.

As creators, we understand the challenges students face worldwide, and we aim to strengthen and expand StudiCircle so it can reach and positively impact students across the globe.

StudiCircle makes studying clearer, smarter, and more enjoyable — one step at a time. Study Better, Together.

AI Tools Disclosure: We used ChatGPT to generate the base of the website and refined it using Lovable.
