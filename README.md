# StudiCircle

## Project info

**URL**: https://studicircle.lovable.app

The clock is ticking, the page is blank, and focus feels impossible — a struggle every student knows. That’s why we created StudiCircle, a gamified productivity platform designed to help students manage their time, tasks, and studying with less stress and more consistency. With 86% of high schoolers procrastinating, we know a change was needed, so we took this into our own hands .

StudiCircle combines focus rooms, AI-powered task planning, Pomodoro timers, a supportive community, and customizable dashboards to make studying more engaging. Students can track daily stats, join or create focus rooms, make motivational posts, and use the AI study tool to plan assignments or get homework help. Tasks are neatly organized into daily, upcoming, and completed sections to keep students accountable.

Gamification — including streaks, XP, levels, themes, and study pets — keeps students motivated, while community posts foster connection and encouragement. The unproductive days are over.

## What’s Next

StudiCircle is off to a great start — but we’re only getting started.

We are working on an AI-powered anti-bullying detector to keep the community positive, safe, and free from harmful interactions.

We also plan to build an AI focus detector that can tell whether a student is staying on-task. If they become idle or drift into unrelated activities, StudiCircle will gently nudge them back toward their goals.

Our goal is to strengthen and expand StudiCircle so it can support students around the world.
